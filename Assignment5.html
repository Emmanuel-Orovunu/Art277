<h2>What is Lemme Help?</h2>
<p>Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:<br/>
senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which
put them at additional risk.<br/>
Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.<br/> <br/>

Our technology platform makes community volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive solution for partners to scale their own impact.<br/>
<br/>Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch requests at scale through the Helping Hands Community platform, while we connect individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.
