           <h2><q>Fully vaccinated</q> doesn't mean <q>immune to COVID-19</q></h2>
           <P>As restriction and mask mandates are dropped around the country, people who are fully vaccinatrd might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a change that you could become infected.<br><br>
              Dr. Cardona explan<br><br>
              "Fully vaccinated' means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offer 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequence of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus."</P><br>
              <h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?<br><br></h2>
              <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at the lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don't have a good immune response to vaccine.<br><br>
              "The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these populations<br.<br>."
