          <p>We've heard it all since the pandemic started-lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don't work, if you already had <a href="">COVID-19</a> you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will
            change your DNA or put a tracking device in your body<br><br>

            it's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But despist all the myths and unban legends, about half of the U.S population is fully vaccinated<br><br>
            Wonderful news, right?<br><br>
            Well, not to some. vaccinated people are up against a new set myths- they're literally magnetic or they're going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.<br><br>
            so, what do viccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others? infectious disease specialist <a href="">Lyssette Cardona</a>, MD, answer those questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.
